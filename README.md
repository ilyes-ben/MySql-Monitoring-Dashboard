To run the web application, simply use the `start.py` script.
It will automatically start the Flask backend and React frontend, and open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Make sure your MySQL database is running on localhost with the root username and root password to get real-time data,
otherwise the application will display loading messages.

If the `start.py` script fails, you will need to manually start the Flask and React applications.
